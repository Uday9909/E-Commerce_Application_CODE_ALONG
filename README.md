# E-Commerce Application using MERN Stack

## Description
As part of this project, I am building a comprehensive E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This hands-on experience will help me explore real-world development practices, equipping me with the skills to create scalable and secure web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview


### Learning Goals 
By the end of this milestone, I:
- Understood the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learned the foundational steps for setting up a new project.
- Gained clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Prepared for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.

### Key Features of the Project
1. **Technology Stack**: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
2. **REST API Creation**: I learned how to build scalable APIs to handle various tasks like user authentication, product management, and order handling.
3. **Authentication**: I explored how to implement secure login and registration functionalities.
4. **Database Schema Design**: I started understanding how to design structured data models using MongoDB.
5. **Backend Development**: I worked on setting up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.
6. **Frontend Development**: Using my knowledge of React.js, I will build a user-friendly interface.


### Core Concepts Covered
#### Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack, making it an ideal choice for building full-stack web applications. Its unified language across the stack simplifies development, making it accessible even for beginners like me.

#### REST API Structure and Endpoints
A REST API enables communication between the client and the server. In this project, I will create endpoints for:
- **User Authentication**: Registering and logging in users.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### Basics of Database Schema Design
I learned about defining the structure and relationships of the data stored in MongoDB.

#### Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication verifies user identity before granting access to specific resources. In this project, I will ensure users authenticate to make purchases or access sensitive information.
